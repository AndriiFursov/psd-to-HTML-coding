            <p>Rodd Brown is the founder of Retro Rustic, a world-class  faux taxidermy company located in Denton, Texas – where he was born, raised and graduated from The University of North Texas. Rodd has spent the past five years perfecting the process of his distinct, handmade, and carefully crafted replicas.His story is one of overcoming tremendous odds, relentless dedication, profound perseverance and life-changing vulnerability.<br><br>In 2010, Rodd began a remarkable and inspiring story of chasing his dream of a world-class faux taxidermy company. Like many artisan Michael Rodd was considered a society misfit, or a “dysfit”, as he refers to the life-long challenge these days: a dysfunctional misfit. He learned during the process to focus on his differences rather than his similarities from everyone else. It was his differences that changed his life and set him on an amazing and incredibly journey of learning who he was, while steadily building his faux taxidermy company.<br><br>“It's tough as hell when you always feel like an outcast. I couldn't' understand why I was such a dysfit until I began digging deep into my desire for art. Once I realized my true differences it changed everything. I eventually stopped trying to be everyone else and I began the extremely vulnerable process of becoming who I really am. I'm a visionary and artisan, plain and simple,” says Rodd.<br><br>Over the next five years, Rodd met with dozens of engineers and other artists trying desperately to bring his vision into reality, and more importantly, become the artist he had been missing his entire life. It wasn't easy, in fact it was an incredible challenge, but he decided early on he would never surrender.<br><br>In 2015, Rodd entered the Dallas Market Center Home and Garden Show won Best of Booth! Retro Rustic immediately became an international company selling in both the United States and Europe.<br><br>Today, Rodd Brown embraces being a dysfit, and embraces his lifelong differences with everyone else. “Being vulnerable to my differences changed my life.” - Rodd Brown</p>
